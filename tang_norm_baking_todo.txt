1. Req size
    gltf req size needs to account for the extra primitive attributes if they are missing.

2. Accessors
    I would assume that all accessors used by primitive attributes would be close together,
    so I would rather not just append the tang and normal accessors, so I will have to insert
    them. So extra space needs to be left in accessors for moving shit around.

3. Primitives
    When parsing these, this is where the insertions should happen.
