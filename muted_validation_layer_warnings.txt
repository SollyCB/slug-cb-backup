1544472022 - write after write in blitting mipmaps:
    As far as I can tell my implementation is exactly the same as the documented implementations online and
    I cannot see any visible issue when rendering. I am not sure how to fix and I cannot see artifacts.

615892639 - gpu av
    gives messages about stuff being disabled but enabled by av which it then turns off itself.

1303270965 - image layout
    this is one that I would never want to mute, but it is complaining about an image layout that
    I am so sure is just incorrect.

1754592629 - depthBiasEnable without depth attachment
    Idk what this one is one about... Just randomly started happening with no changes to renderpasses.
